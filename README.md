# Overview
Imagine that you have a scatter (XY) plot. It is not always easy to see the trends and to tell the story behind the data.

Smoothing spline helps you to visualize and understand noisy scatterplot data.

Here is how it works:
* Define the fields for horizontal and vertical axes of the scatterplot
* Controll the smoothness of the smoothing spline
* Control the confidence levels or the spline curve (or even turn them off)
* Define the colors and the rest of graphical attributes to meet your specific needs

R package dependencies(auto-installed): graphics, scales, reshape

Supports R versions: R 3.3.1, R 3.3.0, MRO 3.3.1, MRO 3.3.0, MRO 3.2.2
